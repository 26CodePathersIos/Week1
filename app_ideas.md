1. Sleep Cycle — app that monitors your sleep cycles in an effort to wake you up when you're in light sleep. it leaves users less groggy in the mornings, illustrates sleep data visually, analyzes sleep statistics over time. this app also is well-thought out in terms of building usage into routine because users use it nightly.

### Forest
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Health 
   - **Mobile:** mobile first experience, primarily to keep user away from interacting with the device for the period of time they select.
   - **Story:** Allows users to remove distractions while also giving them satisfaction(forest progress).
   - **Market:** Mostly anyone who struggles from focusing while completing a task because of their mobile device.(students, adults)
   - **Habit:** Users can set up a timer for focusing and leave their phone. App sends notification when timer runs out and plants a new tree. If user uses the phone during the timer, the plant is destroyed. They can share their progress to growing a forest with their contacts.
   - **Scope:** Apps like forest did exist but didn't have the clean UI that forest had. Forest also added the "growing trees" reward which hooks users to the app.

### Philz App 
- **Category:** Lifestyle
    - **Mobile:** 
    - Benefits of using an app:
        - you can order on the go without having to launch a website in your browser 
        - location services help you select which shop to pick up your drink from 
        - credit card information is already inserted into the app and you can use Face ID / passcode / touch ID to securely order your drink 
        - more interactive experience by sliding through drinks than clicking through them on a website 
        - real-time push notifications for when your drink is ready to save extra time so user can show up without having to wait longer for drink 
  - **Story:**
      - value is evident for people on-the-go, which is common in the mornings when getting coffee 
      - one detterrent for people from getting coffee from Philz could be the time it takes to order and wait for the drink in-store, but the time that the app saves users might convince them to drink Philz more often 
      - my friends/peers would respond well to this app, as there is little advantage for common Philz visitors to order in store if they are in a rush 
  - **Habit:**
      -  an average user would probably use the app every time they want to order Philz. the frequency could differ depending on people's habits, but for many people, drinking coffee is a daily ritual and the app can be easily integrated into their morning routines 
  - **Scope**
      - the app features don't seem to be too technicially challenging; a stripped down version that simply let users order their drinks would still be interesting and meaningful to build, but the extra features like the visuals and the push notifications do help make for a more interactive experience. 
      - the product is clearly defined in that the function and benefits of using the app are easy to identify and seem as they would be valid for many Philz drinkers.

## New App Ideas - List
1. Attendance tracker
    - Allows people to input when they start or end their shifts or classes, mostly aimed at small bussiness owners and colleges. Allows for streamline use by potentially id or key cards to allow the ability to report how many hours were spent doing an activity, such as working the cash register, taking a class, doing inventory, etc. 
2. College dining halls dietary needs app

Students can type in their allergies or other needs and customize their profiles on their accounts beforehand, and then they can view menu options every day before going to eat. I noticed that it isn't always very clear regarding food allergies in my dining halls and think this app could help save time for students and dining hall staff by diminishing the need to inquire about special dietary options.

    - Gathers events from Facebook that are located on-campus and adds them to sporting event calendars and other events listed on campus website into an app for students to see at-a-glance what they can attend

2. College dining halls dietary needs app
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Health 
**Mobile:**
    - Users can use location services to see which dining hall is closer, push-notifications for 30 minutes before the dining hall will close to ensure that they can come in time, and users can call the dining halls if they have any specific questions through the app. 
**Story:**
    - Filters current menu options by dietary needs, e.g. allergies, Kosher and Halal meal options, vegan and vegitarian options. Students can type in their allergies or other needs and customize their profiles on their accounts beforehand, and then they can view menu options every day before going to eat.

   - Audience is niche, but for college campuses with large freshman/undergrad populations, it seems that the app would provide value to enough users 
   - **Habit:** Users can use this app everyday before coming to their dining halls. 
   - **Scope:** This app seems to be complex if we got all of the features, but perhaps if we had a simple option to filter the data from the campus dining hall website, it would be reasonable to design within the scope of this course. 
3. Campus Events app 
    **Description** 
    - **Category** Lifestyle 
    - **Mobile** This app makes creates a calendar of ongoing campus events based on university calendar, facebook events and other sources. The use of a mobile app is beneficial because location services can help users see how far away events are and figure out how to transport themselves there

    - **Market** small bussiness owners and college, especially work study programs
    - **Habit** Is used by students whenever they find themzelves having some free time and wanting to see what options for events they currently have on campus 
   -  **Scope** this app seems slightly complicated in that it has to take and process data from multiple sources, but perhaps designing it would be more do-able in the length of our course.
